## Abstract

This study presents a new semi-supervised action recognition method via adaptive feature analysis. We assume that action videos can be regarded as data points in embedding manifold subspace, and their matching problem can be quantified through a specific Grassmannian kernel function while integrating feature correlation exploration and data similarity measurement into a joint framework. By maximizing the intra-class compactness based on labeled data, our algorithm can learn multiple features and leverage unlabeled data to enhance recognition. We introduce the Grassmannian kernels and the Projected Barzilaiâ€“Borwein (PBB) method to train a subspace projection matrix as a classifier. Experiment results show our method has outperformed the compared approaches when a few labeled training samples are available.
